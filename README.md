Nand2Tetris
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Nand2Tetris online course!
This course, created by Dr. Noam Nisan and Dr. Shimon Schocken, is an introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer science and engineering, using the process of building a simple computer from scratch as the primary learning tool.

The course is divided into 12 projects, each building upon the previous one:
### Project 1: Boolean Logic
- Introduces the basic building blocks of computer hardware, including gates and circuits, and teaches how to implement basic boolean logic operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.
### Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic 
- Builds upon the concepts learned in Project 1 by teaching how to implement basic arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction using boolean logic.
### Project 3: Sequential Logic 
- Introduces the concept of memory and teaches how to build registers and counters using sequential logic.
### Project 4: Machine Language 
- Explains the basic concepts of machine language and assembly language, including instruction sets and assembly language programming.
### Project 5: Computer Architecture 
- Teaches how to build a simple computer using the concepts and building blocks developed in the previous projects. The computer, called the Hack computer, can run programs written in the Hack assembly language.
### Project 6: Assembler 
- Builds an assembler, a program that translates assembly language programs into machine language programs that can be run on the Hack computer.
### Project 7: Virtual Machine I: Stack Arithmetic 
- Teaches how to implement a simple virtual machine that can run programs written in a stack-based assembly language.
### Project 8: Virtual Machine II: Program Control
- Continues the development of the virtual machine by adding support for program control instructions such as branching and subroutines.
### Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis 
- Introduces the basic concepts of compilers and teaches how to implement a simple compiler for the Jack programming language.
### Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation
- Continues the development of the Jack compiler by adding code generation capabilities.
### Project 12: Operating System
- Teaches how to implement a simple operating system for the Hack computer. The operating system, called the Hack OS, supports basic file operations and multitasking.

In this course, one learns how computers work at the most basic level and gain a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts of computer science and engineering. By the end of the course, one will build a  computer and operating system from scratch!
